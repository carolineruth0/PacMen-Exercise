Title: PacMen Exercise

Description: This project shows a PacMen go back and forth across the screen. The files in this project contain code provided by the Full Stack Development with MERN course.

How to run: Download and then drag and drop the HTML file on the browser.

Future improvements: I would like to figure out how to make the PacMen go up and down as well.
